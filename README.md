GraphQL Short URL Web App
Welcome to the GraphQL Short URL Web App! This application allows you to shorten long URLs using GraphQL queries. Instead of relying on traditional REST APIs, this app employs GraphQL for a more efficient and flexible API interaction.

With this app, you can create short aliases for long URLs, making them easier to share and manage. The GraphQL approach enables you to customize your queries to retrieve only the data you need, enhancing performance and reducing over-fetching.
